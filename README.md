# Do you want HDD lights for disks that are tucked away inside your chassis???!

## This software may be for you!

A simple STM32Duino sketch + perl script to feed it that creates a panel of HDD LEDs for my 8 disk software RAID-6 array

Ingredients:
 * ["Blue Pill" STM32 Board](http://wiki.stm32duino.com/index.php?title=Blue_Pill) 
 * [Keyes K845041 8 LED Weird Board](http://www.ebay.com/itm/172319919941)
 * DuPont female to female cables
 * A Dryer sheet or something to diffuse the super bright LEDs
 * I use the STLink interface to program the Blue Pill but you can use whatever you want.

Code:
 * Arduino: [/ino/DiskLEDs/DiskLEDs.ino](../blob/master/DiskLEDs/DiskLEDs.ino)
 * Perl Script: [/perl/serial_activity_spurter.pl](../blob/master/perl/serial_activity_spurter.pl)
 * Setup Serial **RUNFIRST** [/perl/setup_serial.pl](../blob/master/perl/setup_serial.pl)

 ### Instructions
 
 I donno, you figure it out, aren't you supposed to be a maker or something like that?  I will help you build one for $700.  Plus one year free support.
